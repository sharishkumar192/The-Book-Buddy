          <h1>About:</h1> 
          <p>MOMENTS, a supplementary reader in English for Class IX, is meant for extensive reading. It is designed to promote a love for reading by exposing the learners to a variety of materials.An attempt has been made to provide learners with a rich reading experience through stories of mystery, adventure, courage, growing up, romance, wit and humour. These carefully selected pieces would cater to the needs and interests of adolescents and hold the mirror up to different aspects of life and people. A deliberate effort has been made to gloss only some potentially difficult words in the stories to aid the reading process. The few questions given under ‘Think About It’ are all global questions, designed to help learners develop their ability of intelligent and imaginative reading. The ‘Talk about It’ section has discussion topics which take a constructive approach to the analysis of contemporary issues. The learners may be encouraged to interact with their classmates or seniors, integrate their understanding of the issues and make a purposeful, personalised, and imaginative oral presentation. A list of suggested readings is given at the end of each story to encourage learners to read extensively and independently. </p>
